<p>Over at my blog <a href="http://rubyist.jaredwhite.com/2015/04/28/3-fun-tricks-with-opal-and-jquery/">Jared White, Rubyist</a>, I've posted a breezy intro to some of the cool things you can do when you pair Ruby-in-the-browser via Opal +&nbsp;jQuery via the opal-jquery gem.</p>
<p style="margin-left:40px">Everyone loves jQuery! Well, almost everyone. It makes interacting with the DOM simple and fast, handling browser events is a breeze, and there are numerous jQuery plugins available that are highly useful and easy to get started using.</p>
<p style="margin-left:40px">As crazy as this might sound, jQuery isn't always a simple pleasure, but that's not jQuery's fault. It's the language you have to use...Javascript. Fortunately, with Opal, that's no longer an issue. Write Ruby code that runs in the browser and directly interfaces with jQuery? Yep, no problem.</p>
